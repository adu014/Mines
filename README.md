Mines Game GUI
This repository contains a Python-based Minesweeper-style game built with Tkinter. Players wager virtual currency and uncover tiles to increase their winnings, avoiding hidden mines. The game offers dynamic risk-reward mechanics, adjustable settings, and a user-friendly interface.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Players click tiles to reveal safe spots, aiming to avoid mines while increasing profits through a multiplier system.
Betting System: Place wagers using the "Bet Half" or "Bet All" options, with real-time updates to balance, profits, and multipliers.
Customizable Settings: Adjust the number of hidden mines (1â€“20) via a dropdown menu, allowing for scalable difficulty.
Dynamic Multipliers: Winnings are determined by a progressive multiplier table based on safe clicks and mine count.
Cash-Out Option: Players can exit early to secure profits or risk continued play for higher rewards.
Game State Management: Handles wins, losses, and restarts seamlessly, resetting the game board and balance for new rounds.
